                <p>
                Pleasure to meet you, my name’s Izzy (she/her), I'm a web designer born and raised in Asia's Pearl of the Orient. Now based in Vancouver, Canada. At heart, I’m an artist, a devoted pixel pusher, and I’m all about creating thoughtful interfaces and experiences that delight the senses. I primarily focus on product design but have a solid grasp on the fundamentals of web development.

                I care a lot about <a href="http://thepoliticsofdesign.com/" target="_blank">The Politics of Design</a> and I'm educating myself on <a href="https://eyeondesign.aiga.org/what-does-it-mean-to-decolonize-design/" target="_blank">Decolonizing Design</a>. I'm dedicated to applying these principles into my design practice and in doing so, I hope I inspire others to do the same as well.

                When I play, I like to take photos of my friends, watch movies (I &lt;3 A24), and I read once in while, but I find myself accumulating more books on my reading list than actually completing them.
